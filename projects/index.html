                <h3>Twitch+: Personalized Twitch resources recommendation engine</h3>
                <h4>Jun 2021 – Aug 2021</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Designed and built a full-stack web application for users to login/logout, search, favorite
                        Twitch resources (stream/video/clip) and get recommendations</li>
                    <li>Built a web page with friendly user experience using React and Ant Design</li>
                    <li>Implemented RESTful APIs to handle HTTP requests and responses using Java servlets and Tomcat
                    </li>
                    <li>Utilized MySQL database on Amazon RDS to store data fetched from Twitch API and deployed the
                        service to Amazon EC2 for better stability</li>
                    <li>Explored multiple recommendation algorithms and extracted game information from Twitch resources
                        to implement a Content-based recommendation algorithm</li>

                <h4>Jul 2021</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Developed a food ordering service via Spring MVC to support registration, menu searching,
                        ordering and checkout</li>
                    <li>Implemented authentication and authorization via Spring security to protect the application from
                        malicious attacks</li>
                    <li>Utilized Hibernate to access and operate the data (menu, restaurants etc.) stored in MySQL
                        database on Amazon RDS</li>
                    <li>Used the Spring Core to loosely decouple all the components in the application</li>
                    <li>Built the client side with ReactJS and Ant Design to allow users to add items to the shopping
                        cart and place orders</li>

                <h3>K-SEA Shell</h3>
                <h4>Feb 2021 – Apr 2021</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Built a Shell in C that serves as an intermediate between the user and the operating system</li>
                    <li>Implemented built-in functions to support commands including ‘help’, ‘exit’, ‘ls’ and ‘cd’</li>
                    <li>upgraded the Shell by implementing and documenting an additional built-in command called ‘game’
                        that launches a guessing game process</li>
                    <li>Coded a function to parse and evaluate the user’s input to decide whether the shell can handle
                        the request</li>

                <h4>Feb 2021 – Apr 2021</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Built a command-line task management application compatible with Windows and macOS following
                        Model-View-Controller architecture and SOLID principles</li>
                    <li>Designed and implemented the underlying workflow for retrieving, modifying, storing and sorting
                        to-dos by interacting with a source CSV file as the database</li>
                    <li>Designed algorithms to validate users’ command-line inputs and perform corresponding tasks (add,
                        complete and display)</li>
